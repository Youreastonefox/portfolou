## Commit messages template

It's based on the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), and adapted to my vision.

**Structure :** `<icon><type>[optional scope]: <description>`

**Possible types :**

- `🔧 feat`: New feature
- `🐞 fix`: Bug fix
- `📝 docs`: Simply documentation or commentaries
- `🎨 style`: Formatting, indentation, linting (no code changes)
- `🔁 refactor`: Refactoring without adding/removing features
- `🚀 perf`: Performance improvements
- `✅ test`: Adding/modifying tests
- `⚙️ chore`: Internal tasks: build, dependencies, configuration, etc.
